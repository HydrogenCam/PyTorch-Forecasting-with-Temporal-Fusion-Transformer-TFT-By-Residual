# PyTorch-Forecasting with Temporal Fusion Transformer (TFT) by Residual

This repository implements **Residual Learning with Temporal Fusion Transformer (TFT)** for short-term electricity demand forecasting.  
The approach combines operator forecasts (e.g., **Total Load Forecast, TLF**) with a TFT that models **residual errors**, keeping baseline accuracy while improving **interpretability** and **responsiveness to short-term shocks**.

---

## âœ¨ Features
- **Residual framework**: predict residuals (`error = target âˆ’ operator_forecast`) and reconstruct target (`target = operator_forecast + error_hat`).
- **Four experiment regimes**: baseline, without operator input, seasonal substitution, and residual learning.
- **Interpretability tools**: Integrated Gradients (IG), Top-k ranking, permutation and zero ablation.
- **Evaluation**: Quantile Loss during training and testing, plus visualization scripts.

## ðŸ“Š Data

The project assumes an hourly electricity dataset with **consumption**, **generation**, **price**, and **weather** features, plus an **operator forecast** column for residual learning.

**Example dataset used:**  
[ðŸ“¦ Kaggle â€“ Energy Consumption, Generation, Prices and Weather (Spain, 2015â€“2018)](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/nicholasjhana/energy-consumption-generation-prices-and-weather)

Place the CSV under `data/` or point to it with `--data_path`.

## ðŸ”¬ Experiments (E0â€“E3)

- **E0 â€“ Baseline**  
  All variables included, TFT predicts target directly.

- **E1 â€“ Without Operator**  
  Operator forecast removed.

- **E2 â€“ Seasonal Substitution**  
  Operator forecast replaced by seasonal baseline.

- **E3 â€“ Residual Learning**  
  TFT predicts residuals and reconstructs the final target.
